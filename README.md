# EdiCLI

A.K.A. Editor Command Line Parser is a lightweight CLI text editor,
after all, *a quick editor for quick changes*. You don't have to use
a full featured text editor or IDE to just delete or add a line on a file.
If you are on my side then, download and install EdiCLI and run `--help`
to see a list with the all awesome commands availables.
